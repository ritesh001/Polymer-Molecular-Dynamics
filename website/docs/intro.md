Let's understand **High Throughput Polymer MD simulations in less than 5 minutes**.

## Overview
This site includes the [Polymer Molecular Dynamics (PMD) package](/api/overview) and guides for performaing high-throughput MD simulations for various properties including:

- Glass transition temperature (Tg)
- Gas diffusivity
- Solvent diffusivity
- Thermal conductivity - upcoming
- Mechanical properties - upcoming
- Viscosity - upcoming
- Melting temperature (Tm) - upcoming

## Getting Started

Get started by **building a simple test system of polyethlyenes (PE) and equilibrating it**.

### What you'll need

- [PMD](https://github.com/Ramprasad-Group/High-Throughput-Polymer-MD-Simulations) and [PSP](https://github.com/Ramprasad-Group/PSP) packages:
  - When installing these packages, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
